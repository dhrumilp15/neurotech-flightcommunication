# neurotech-flightcommunication

This is the repo where some of my work for Neurotech U of T lives!

This produces [SBUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBus) packets from a Raspberry Pi to a flight controller!

This is still a work in-progress, but feel free to check out the rest of my work:

- [A Unity Streaming Service for VR](https://github.com/dhrumilp15/UnityVRStreaming)
